The purpose of this program is to give an exact solution of quantum mechanic problem using Mixed Quantum-Classical Liouville Equation (MQCLE) by Discrete Variable Representation (DVR).

The derivatives are calculated by infinite order finite difference, and the boundary is a reflective one.

It requires C++17 or newer C++ standards when compiling and needs connection to Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL).
