The purpose of this program is to give an exact solution of quantum mechanic problem using Mixed Quantum-Classical Liouville Equation (MQCLE) by Discrete Variable Representation (DVR).

The derivatives are calculated by infinite order finite difference, and the boundary is a reflective one.

It requires C++17 or newer C++ standards when compiling and needs connection to Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL).

To build, simply run "make" with Intel(R) compilers, or to modify makefile for other compilers. Then running bat.sh or the executable mqcl with proper input. The input file format is in bat.sh.

This is going to merge with schrodinger equation into one folder.
