The purpose of this program is to give an exact solution of quantum mechanic problem using Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) in J. Chem. Phys., 1992, 96(3): 1982-1991, with Absorbing Boundary Condition in J. Chem. Phys., 2002, 117(21): 9552-9559 and J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 120(5): 2247-2254.

This program could be used to solve exact solution under diabatic basis ONLY.

It requires C++17 or newer C++ standards when compiling and needs connection to Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (MKL).
