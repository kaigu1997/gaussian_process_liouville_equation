This is the folder of documents, including a FFT notes (which is not published on any publications, but you can find it [here](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/fft-deriv.pdf)), and my reading notes - in Simplified Chinese and in LaTeX.

The pdf files corresponding to the LaTeX are also provided, while you can compile the LaTeX yourself - with UTF8 and [CTEX](www.ctex.org) package.
